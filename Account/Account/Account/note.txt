State pattern:
- object of the state class represents one state
- change the object when you want to change the state
- consequences of the State Pattern:
	- class doesnt have to represent its state explicitly anymore
	- class doesnt have to manage state transition logic
	- no more branching
	- Runtime type of the state object replace branching
	- Dynamic dispatch used to choose one implementation or the other 
- benefits of State pattern:
	- class that uses states becomes simple
	- it can focus on its primary role
	- other roles are delegated to concrete state classes
	- each concrete class is simple

Pohladom na State objektu "Account" mozno povedat ze jeho responsibilities su:
	public decimal Balance { get; private set; }
	private bool IsVerified { get; set; }
	private bool IsClosed { get; set; } 
	- Account manazuje Balance
	- manazuje Closed a Verified state

Callback pattern applied:
1. Do the custom work
2. Call back

INFO: 
- dont keep money as Decimal --> introduce special Money class to keep amount and currency together

Advice:
- let the class do only one thing (a.k.a. Single Resposibility Principle - SRP)
e.g. Account only takes care of the balane

 Consequences of separated responsibilities:
	- each class is doing one thing
	- one new requirement means one new class will be added
	- new requirement doesnt require an existing class to change

Bad desing:
	- a class which is doing everything itself
	- this typically leads to if-then-else instructions everywhere

Better design:
	- move separate implementations to separate state classes
	- substitute the state object to substitute implementation
